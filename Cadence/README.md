Hi, how are you?

I had a little trouble understanding what was to be done, 
especially with regard to the input. with that, I decided to make a slot machine my way.


It basically works like this: 
it runs all the slots on each line, one by one with
a random interval defined by the range seted in "getRandomNum", 

after completing the cycle in which it rotates completely, it will start new cycles rotating only the slots from "positionToStart", also with a random time, replacing the function "Anticipation", after finishing everything the final result will be in "display".
I await your return, thank you!
